Another thing that I like to do is go to the beach.  What I like to do at the beach is: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>body board</li>
	<li>dive</li>
	<li>hunt for crabs</li>
	<li>and play in the sand</li>
</ul>
<p>
  My favorite beach is Makapu'u beach in Waimanalo.  The reason it's my favorite is because it's close to where I live for starters.  Also 
  it's a good place to dive, especially when it's flat.  Occasionally it has some waves which is good for surfers.  Another reason I think
  it's good is that you can set up on the beach with your family and stay there all day, which is what me and my family usually do.
