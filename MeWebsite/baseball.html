<h1>
	Baseball
</h1>
<p style="border-style: solid; border-color: gray">

	I started playing baseball when I was 7, and even now I still play, though I don't play for my school.  I started off playing little league for a few years,
	then I moved over to pony.  When I got into high school, I played all four years of high school.  Three years at Kailua and one year at Kalaheo High.  I ended up not playing
	 in college so that I could focus a little more on my studies.  Though, as of now, I do still play in an outside league every once in a while.
